# Flip-O-Matic
An edited version of MrStump's [Roll-O-Matic](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878533440) optimised for coins.

To use this place it into a custom infinite bag with the following mesh and diffuse, then put a coin of your choice inside it:

This object can flip 1-9 copies of any coins you like in a random and aestheticly pleasing way at the push of a button, then (optionally) print out the results of the flip and clean up old coins automatically either immediatly, when flipping again, or after 3 seconds (configurable in the right-click menu).

Additionally this object acts as an infinite bag for conventional coins, should the user wish to flip manually for whatever reason.

The main changes from the original Roll-O-Matic are changed text on the print-outs, a stronger, single axis flip that looks better with coins, fixing the issue with flipping with an empty bag, and moving some options from the script itself to the right-click menu.
